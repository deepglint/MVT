# Margin based Vision Transformer


## MVT-1.5 RICE  


### ðŸ’¡ Highlights

RICE efficiently processes diverse semantic regions
within the image using a single forward pass. The model jointly captures both general visual semantics (objects) and OCR semantics
(texts), seamlessly integrating them into a unified representation.

### ðŸ’¡ Experiments

Comprehensive performance comparison of RICE with state-of-the-art vision encoders. For all experiments within the LLaVA-NeXT framework, we adopt a high-resolution tiling strategy: each input image is divided into a 2Ã—2+1 grid of crops, where each crop matches the pre-training resolution of the backbone model (e.g., 336px, 378px, or 560px).
